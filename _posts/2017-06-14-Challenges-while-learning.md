title: The biggest challenge I've faced when learning to develop

In my journey of learning to develop, I have encountered several challenges, but the number ONE was...

## Learning the programing language

----------------------------------
As a bilingual speaker (trilingual in the near future), I know learning a new language is complicated, from learning the vocabulary, grammar, phonetics and the meaning of each word is a whole new ball game.

While learning to become a Web Developer is learning the coding language, learning the meaning of words, understanding the syntax and the structure of the programs, has been a real challenge.

I have tried to memorize the words and their meaning while learning how to code, which was not been efficient, so I decided just to learn as I go. After learning one program, I came to found out that each program has their own language and syntax. In reality, Web Developing is compiled of different programs which in turn each has its own language and syntactic rules. But again that is where practice comes at hand, as I learn each program, only practice will give me the ability to memorize the language and syntax.

Learning each programming language is basically teaching oneself, and when I face a language barrier I try to first analyze the concept, try to make sense of it, if I can't come up with a solution there is always your good ole friend "Google". Although sometimes I don't get my question answered, I try to read about the concept being asked and at the same time trying to resolve it on my own.

----------------------------

While knowing you have a mentor to ask questions, I try to ask him as my last resort, after I have struggled, researched and came empty handed.

Learning Web Development will never stop, I have come to the understanding that I have to take one day at the time while keeping in mind that only time, dedication and practice will always be my best teacher and friend.
