As a Frontend Developer my goals are as follows:

## 1-. Always strive to manage my time wisely

As projects come my way, I would need to plan my work projects by writing down the issues that need to be resolved first. Is like creating a GPS map in order to get to the right place in the less amount of time, avoiding traffic delays and accidents. Just like in real life, before I am heading to a place I always look at Google map ahead of time, verifying the time that I plan to depart, which then Google map will take into consideration the traffic expected at the time of my future departure. The same concept I plan to integrate into my projects. By tracing a map it will keep my work schedule organized, always taking in consideration setback delays. So by developing a plan of action, with self-discipline, managing my time wisely, keeping focused on the time needed to achieve my goal, I will reduce stress and embrace creativity.   

## 2.- Ask for help when needed
In any job, there is always a person that knows more than you, regardless of how many years you have been working at the same job, there will always be a more knowledgeable person. As a junior developer I am sure I will get stuck in different parts of a project, so one of my goals is to have a mentor which will help me resolve any concerns that would come up and give me advise how to avoid mistakes. Always the expertise of a mentor is welcomed at any time, and I will love to learn from the best as learning from mistakes and errors.

## 3- Improve my Web Development skills
As science and medicine continue to advance, so does Computer technology. In the web development field, there will always be something new to learn, so I will never stop learning. A wise man once said:

Always improving your skills by learning is a way to stay afloat, although there is no such thing as a failsafe plan, you always want to upgrade your knowledge by attending boot camps, courses, conferences, and by reading books, although knowledge is power, you also need to keep practicing the knowledge attained, as Patrick Rothfuss said "practice makes the master".

## 4.- Always give 110% of myself
One of my lifetime mottos is always walking the extra mile and giving not 100% but giving 110% of my efforts in whatever project I perform. By doing that we can achieve perfection and keep our co-workers, boss, friends, and family happy. If I give a 110% in my marriage it will succeed, if I give 110% commitment in a project we will ensure that we will achieve success.

## 5.-Enjoy life
Life is a journey, by living each moment to its fullest we will conquer happiness, not after the completion of the goal, but while achieving your goal. Every step of the journey should be full of joy while learning from mistakes and using it as a stepping stone to go up to the next level. Happiness is a state of mind, each individual chooses to portray, positive thinking brings positive results. Remember each minute that went by will never come back, take a deep breath and smile, live and enjoy the present while dreaming of the future !!!
