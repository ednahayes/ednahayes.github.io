## Problem
In the process of building this Capstone, I encountered issues on how to store the data for input since the form to be translated was very lengthy. My mentor suggested that using JSON it would make it easier at the long run, since that same form will be translated in different languages.


## Solution
A user will be able to log in and out of the Capstone application, and will have the option to select the form that is needed to be filled out.

Once a form is selected he will be able to read in the language of their choice and fill out the form as needed

As an administrator, you will have access to all the users and the forms
they have filled out.

This Capstone application is still a work in progress since we will be adding more forms in different languages.
