title:  My experience with Bloc
---

My journey into development was started after High School when I attended Microsoft Sigma

school to become a computer administrator, many years ago. As time passed, my priorities

changed, from becoming a computer nerd, to becoming a wife, then a mom.

I raised two children, one is almost an adult, the other one is becoming a little boy

who is only four years old, but with a longing to be 17, so he can drive.



About 2 years ago I started a course with a learning company to get my feet wet in the

web development field, it was a "learn on your own tedious way" type of school, which made it

more difficult to continue after being a mom and working full-time. Still, that small flame of

wanting to learn more about Web Development was burning in the back burner of my mind.

As each year passed by, I had a hesitation to get back in the computer field, one of them was

thinking there are still stereotypes for being a woman who codes. The computer industry has

always being more proactive in having men as coders.  another being the thought that my

computer knowledge was outdated. All of these negative thoughts embraced my wishes.


Finally, last year, my husband told me how he thought I would be an excellent Web Developer

 since I always pay attention to details, I like designing, creating and building. His

 encouragement and help, motivated me to pursue again, Web Development.

 After researching on-line for a great teaching school, we discovered Bloc School. Bloc had

 a program where you set your own hours to study on-line, they provide you with a mentor,

 and they motivated woman who would like to code, by granting a discount.

 All of this positive affirmations opened up my way of looking at Web Development and

 inspired me to strive for greatness as a "woman who codes".

 After looking at Bloc we realized that it had the structure and mentorship support needed

 for me to learn, so I enrolled in the Web Development Track, shortly after.

 It has been fun but yet stressful at the same time, trying to learn new concepts. My mentor

 has been a great

 challenge, I doubt I will ever catch up with technology, it advances on a daily basis just

 like science and medicine.

 As a Bloc student I have learned a lot and still continue to learn, as a matter of fact,

 I doubt I will ever stop learning.
