# PORTFOLIO

![Portfolio Home Page](/images/newPO.png)

This portfolio was created from a Jekyll Base template.

This is a basic application made with Atom that displays the different projects that I made which includes the following features:

1. HTML and stylesheets.
2. Blog posts.
3. A loop in `index.html` to show the posts.
4. Markdown Syntax.
5. A config file with a few common presets.

## Notes

This project *doesn't* use the [gem-based themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) introduced in Jekyll 3.2.
