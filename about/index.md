<div class="about container">
<p>I am a focused developer working with JQuery, AngularJS and Rails.
</p>

<p>I love learning about health and wellness thru a natural perspective, and my passion is to live a healthy life while helping and coaching others do the same.
</p>
<p>
We live oblivious to the fact that we are surrounded by a polluted environment.
</p>
<p>Did you know that the average woman has been exposed to an average of 515 synthetic chemicals each day?
</p>
<p> Did you know that 60% of what we put onto our skin is absorbed into our bodies??
</p>
<p>All of these chemicals are in our regular household products, such as soaps, detergents, cleaners, lawn care products, personal products, such as make-up, shampoo, lotions, foods which a loaded with pesticides. These chemicals enter our body by topical, ingestive or inhaled manner, after they enter our bodies they damage the DNA in our cells, if the cell doesn't have the capability to repair herself then it can die. Unrepaired cells can lead to a mutation which could cause cancer.</p>

<p>It is so sad that big companies that have our health in their hands are putting these toxic chemicals in the products we use for consumption and for use. They make money by making us sick because in turn we will purchase their chemical loaded medication to try to make us feel better and we think is a medicine which will heal us when in reality is keeping us sick.</p>

<p>It is a cycle, we purchase products to make us feel and look good, like make-up which in turn will give us cancer, so then we have to purchase medicine to cure that cancer, but that medicine is not going to cure the cancer is just going to prolong our sickly life so we can continue to pay for the medicine. It is just a cycle. The only one that benefits at the end is big pharma companies and their affiliated friends.</p>

<p>By sharing this information we are making people aware, we are spreading the knowledge and they can take action by changing their lifestyle. That is why my passion is for every single human being to improve their health, and stop purchasing products which in turn are making them sick and killing them.</p>

<p>So, lets make this world a better place by living a healthy, chemical-free life, while enjoying every minute of it.</p>
